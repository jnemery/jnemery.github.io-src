Title: Alan Turing

In my Theory of Computation class, we are learning about Turing machines. And with that we are learning about Alan Turing. You see, we didn’t talk a lot about him, because at the end of the day we aren’t sitting in class to learn about a man we are sitting there to learn about what he did. So.. My professor could have just said “He did great things and wow there is an award named after him” but, she didn’t. She mentioned that he was gay, and she mentioned that he killed himself because of that.

So, why write a blog about that? Good question.

You see, I am queer. And I am a computer science major. And I don’t see myself in curriculum, but that is okay because I don’t really expect it. I am not like social work students, who hear about real lives on a daily basis. I learn about programming language theory, and math… Hard science, you don’t talk about people you talk about numbers and theories. And when my professor casually mentioned that one of the most influential computer scientists was gay…. That mattered. I was texting my advisor like crazy, telling her about it. It made an impact on me in a way that I didn’t expect.

I am trying to define this blog. I have sat on this for weeks, trying to figure out if I want to write about advocacy and my life as an LGBTQ+ student on IUPUI’s campus, or if I want to make this about random anecdotes from my daily life, or if I want this to be a technical blog about my studies and what I learn at work. And I am realizing that these are all very very different and separated parts of my identity. I am realizing that I am not ashamed of any of these different parts, and that even though this is on my GitHub, I don’t want to work somewhere who will not accept me for my queer identity. I am not gay first, it is not my entire identity, but I need to end up somewhere I feel safe being me. With this being said, I have decided that I will write this blog when I write it, and it will be whatever it needs to be. I can categorize how I see fit, and that will be that.

So welcome to my ramblings. This blog post isn’t the most professional, but it is midnight on a Monday evening, and I spent the last 2 hours of my day listening to students tell me about how they were harassed on campus for flying a gay flag in their dorm room (on the queer floor, mind you), how a trans* student is being forced to shower with people of a different gender, and how a student’s laptop was shattered because a bigoted student threw it on the floor. 

In the end, this blog post wasn’t about Alan Turing at all, but hey… Whatever.
