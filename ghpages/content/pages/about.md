Hi! My name is Jennifer Emery and I was inspired to start this blog by Taylor Brazelton (see his blog [here](https://www.taylorbrazelton.com "Taylor Brazelton Blog")!).
I am currently a senior at IUPUI majoring in Computer Science. 
I want to document the end of my education and experience at IUPUI.
